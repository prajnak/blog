Home delivery is a competitive market that is becoming increasingly popular. Delivery trucks are scattered within almost every region of the world, but with the rapidly increasing demand the only current option is to put more vehicles and people on the roads. Talon is a future delivery system designed to speed up, reduce costs, and safely get packages to customers. As opposed to flying from a warehouse for each delivery, Talon can make short flights and deliver a package from pre-existing delivery trucks. Launching and returning to the vehicle autonomously, the end goal of our project is to improve the overall efficiency and autonomy of a delivery route

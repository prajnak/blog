I'd like to start a series on my blog about the latest advances in the fields of
machine learning and deep learning, with a focus on papers that have
applications for a multitude of computer vision processing tasks.

Someone once explained to me that the best way to understand a subject is to try
explain it to other people. Reasons why this works include:
- You learn everything you thought you understood but didn't really
  understand cause if you didn't really understand it the first time, you'll
  end up making no sense to the person you're explaining this to
  
- You'll be surprised how easily your brain realizes when it's trying to explain
  a process it doesn't exactly understand. This is usually followed by a lot of
  stammering and apologies for not knowing the topic at hand

Follow along for the first one in this series. (It's not up as of Nov 25 2016)

For those of you who know, I spent about 8 months in 2014 working in Santa Clara, CA and really liked my times there. I lived in Sunnyvale and used to go to San Francisco, Santa Cruz, Palo Alto and Mountain View quite often. Now, I  really liked living in the Bay Area but I have a lot of doubts about the sustainability of the tech sector and its practices in the area. For example, the artificial housing shortage perpetrated by the [NIMBYs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY), [the bad public transit system](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/us/bay-areas-disjointed-public-transit-network-inspires-a-call-for-harmony.html?_r=0), the insane eceonomic inequality (especially in SF)

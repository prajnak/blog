Today, we learn a little bit about [Go](https://golang.org/), a compiled, statically typed, garbage collected programming language, which ships concurrency primitives in its standard library. 

This is quite the change from the usual land of calback hell if you're using Node.js to do concurrent tasks, although, the [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise), introduced in [ECMAScript 2015](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) has made this much easier. To be honest though, most users of concurrency in Nodejs land used to be web developers, and thus, want to use JavaScript for things other than building client facing web applications. If you're upto date with the latest happenings in JS land, this shouldn't be news to you. Anyway, enough with the asides - let's go back to Go (***hue hue hue ***).

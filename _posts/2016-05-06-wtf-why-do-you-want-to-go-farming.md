## Here's why
I went to [Phil's](http://www.uwimprint.ca/article/2547-filthy-philthy-phils) after submitting the final paper of my undergrad career and it was fun, as usual. The day after was different from my usual groggy hangover mornings as I was suddenly seized with the need to get over my current state, which, summarized in two words, can be called CITY LIFE. I did not get high, like I usually do to get over my hangover nor did I smoke a cigarette for the oh so sweet heady rush followed by the lingering aroma of burnt tobacco and ash..barfff \s.

Let's rewind a little bit here to 2012, the year I started smoking cigarettes regularly. SPOILER ALERT! I did it to look cool. No, really! That summer, I moved to a town called Peterborough in Ontario, which, btw, is like an hour's bike ride from Omemee, the birthplace of Neil Young! Here's [Harvest Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2MtEsrcTTs) and my favorite cover of this song by [Poolside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suWbFPaVoEA) for good measure. Now, Peterborough was beautiful and I looked super cool. I'm a huge narcissist, so here's a picture of me looking cool in 2012.

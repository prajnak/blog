## Here's why
I went to [Phil's](http://www.uwimprint.ca/article/2547-filthy-philthy-phils) after submitting the final paper of my undergrad career and it was fun, as usual. The day after was different from my usual groggy hangover mornings as I was suddenly seized with the need to get over my current state, which, summarized in two words, can be called CITY LIFE. I did not get high, like I usually do to get over my hangover nor did I smoke a cigarette for the oh so sweet heady rush followed by the lingering aroma of burnt tobacco and ash..barfff \s.

Let's rewind a little bit here to 2012, the year I started smoking cigarettes regularly. SPOILER ALERT! I did it to look cool. No, really! That summer, I moved to a town called Peterborough in Ontario, which, btw, is like an hour's bike ride from Omemee, the birthplace of Neil Young! Here's [Harvest Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2MtEsrcTTs) and my favorite cover of this song by [Poolside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suWbFPaVoEA) for good measure. Now, Peterborough was beautiful and I looked super cool. I'm a huge narcissist, so here's a picture of me looking cool in 2012.

Coming back to the present, I'd have loved to go on a graduation trip to see the wonders of this world but I have this overwhelming desire to realize myself before I try to make sense of everything around me. Thus, I think some time away from most people and civilization will do me good. A few things I'd like to change about myself during this trip:

1.Quit smoking once and for all. I haven't touched a cig in a week so that's a start.
2.Live healthy by eating healthy and exercising. I think an 8-to-5 job farm job should take care of this pretty damn well

This post has gone all over the place but I think it gets the message across. Now, onto Vancouver to meet friends I made from Peterborough and Waterloo and onwards to Vancouver Island from there. Cheers!

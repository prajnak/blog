I spent a couple days in Vancouver with Jackie, who I first met in Peterborough coincidentally and Ankit. Checked out Stanley Park on bike with Jackie on the first day. It's so pretty here!

Jackie's apartment has some sweet views as well!

Then I went roaming around town the next day and went to the Contemporary Art Gallery

If you thought Jackie's views were sweet, Ankit's apartment was just insane. Here's me looking happy!

Vancouver is just like San Francisco! You have the sweet greenery everywhere, ocean nearby, mountains all around etc. Also, everyone is super fit and healthy over here.
